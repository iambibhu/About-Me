Hi, I am Bibhu Prasad
Software Developer at day, Video Content Creator at Night.

I have recently completed my post-graduation MCA. I'm experienced in technical skills, including HTML, CSS, Python, SQL, and Linux/Unix. I'm always adding new skills to my professional range. I'm eager to meet other Software Engineers in this area. So please feel free to connect.

When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time playing musical instruments like Guitar and playing video games. It's a great de-stressor. It ensures that I'm always at my best while at work.
